                <p>LOOK OUT FOR MY EXCITING NEW BOOK</p>
                <p>“NINA, <span class="splendid">St Tropez</span>” OUT JUNE 2014 .</p>
                <p>“IT ALL STARTED WHEN MY PARENTS MET ON THE BEACHES OF ST TROPEZ DURING THE SUMMER HOLIDAYS WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG. SINCE THEN, MY FAMILY HAS CONTINUED TO COME TO THIS BEAUTIFUL LITTLE FISHING TOWN EVERY YEAR, AND I HAVEN’T SPENT A SINGLE SUMMER AWAY FROM IT SINCE I WAS BORN. THIS BOOK IS MY PERSONAL FOOD-THEMED JOURNEY ROUND THIS HISTORIC SEASIDE TOWN AND SURROUNDING AREA.  IN MY 70S CITROËN VAN, OUR NEIGHBOUR’S BOAT AND AT TIMES ON MY TRUSTY BICYCLE, I LOVE TO EXPLORE PROVENCAL CUISINE AND CREATE RECIPES INSPIRED BY THE LOCALS, PLACES AND STORIES OF MY SUMMERS HERE. I AM PASSIONATE ABOUT THE ST TROPEZ STYLE OF COOKING THAT IS PRINCIPALLY ABOUT STRONG, FRESH FLAVOURS CREATING SOMETHING COLOURFUL AND ABOVE ALL, UTTERLY DELICIOUS.”</p>
